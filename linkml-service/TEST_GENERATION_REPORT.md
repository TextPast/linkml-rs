# LinkML Service Test Generation Report

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive test coverage has been generated for all LinkML service fixes identified in the request. This report documents the testing strategy, coverage metrics, and validation approach that follows RootReal's strict testing standards with >90% unit test coverage and >80% integration test coverage targets.

## Fixed Issues Addressed

### 1. CLI Module Fixes (`cli.rs`)
**Issue**: Static method conversion - `calculate_inheritance_depth` was incorrectly trying to access `self` parameter in a static context.

**Fix Applied**:
- Converted `calculate_inheritance_depth` from instance method to static method
- Updated call sites to use `Self::calculate_inheritance_depth`
- Preserved all existing functionality and recursion protection

**Tests Generated**:
- `tests/cli_static_methods_simple_test.rs` - Comprehensive unit tests for inheritance depth calculation
- Test scenarios: Simple inheritance, circular protection, missing parents, deep chains, edge cases
- Performance validation for deep inheritance structures (up to depth 100)
